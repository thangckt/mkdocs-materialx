# Getting started

MaterialX for MkDocs is a powerful documentation framework on top of [MkDocs],
a static site generator, you can install MaterialX for MkDocs with [`pip`][pip].

  [MkDocs]: https://www.mkdocs.org
  [pip]: #with-pip

## Installation

### with pip <small>recommended</small> { #with-pip data-toc-label="with pip" }

MaterialX for MkDocs is published as a [Python package] and can be installed with
`pip`, ideally by using a [virtual environment]. Open up a terminal and install
MaterialX for MkDocs with:

=== "Latest"

    ``` sh
    pip install mkdocs-materialx
    ```

=== "10.x"

    ``` sh
    pip install mkdocs-materialx=="10.*" # (1)!
    ```

    1.  MaterialX for MkDocs uses [semantic versioning][^2], which is why it's a
        good idea to limit upgrades to the current major version.

        This will make sure that you don't accidentally [upgrade to the next
        major version], which may include breaking changes that silently corrupt
        your site. 

  [^2]:
    Note that improvements of existing features are sometimes released as
    patch releases, like for example improved rendering of content tabs, as
    they're not considered to be new features.

This will automatically install compatible versions of all dependencies:
[MkDocs], [Markdown], [Pygments] and [Python Markdown Extensions]. MaterialX for MkDocs always strives to support the latest versions, so there's no need to install those packages separately.
