## MaterialX

<br />

**MaterialX**, the next generation of mkdocs-material, build beautiful sites the way you already know and love, based on `mkdocs-material-9.7.1` and named `X`, it provides ongoing maintenance and updates.

<details>
  <summary> Why MaterialX ? </summary>
  <br />
  <p>
    The MkDocs project is nearing its end due to personal issues involving its original author. He has ceased updates for MkDocs and intends to release a completely new 2.0 version as a replacement. However, this new version is entirely incompatible with the existing ecosystem. It is an entirely separate project that merely carries the MkDocs name, and an accidental upgrade will result in devastating damage.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a result, to move away from reliance on MkDocs, the team behind the popular mkdocs-material theme framework has discontinued its maintenance and shifted to developing an entirely new alternative project named Zensical. While it features a modern architecture, it is incompatible with the original MkDocs ecosystem (no plugin support), incurs high migration costs (all configurations must be rebuilt from scratch), and still lacks many essential features.
  </p>
  <p>
    To ensure the continued stable operation of existing MkDocs projects and ecosystem, a new community-driven successor to MkDocs has emerged: <a href="https://github.com/ProperDocs/properdocs">ProperDocs</a> (based on MkDocs 1.6.1). It will provide ongoing updates and maintenance while remaining fully compatible with the original MkDocs ecosystem.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, mkdocs-material also has a new successor: <strong>MaterialX</strong> (based on mkdocs-material 9.7.1). It will also receive ongoing updates and maintenance, with full compatibility with the original ecosystem and zero migration costs.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>MaterialX</strong> preserves the <strong>rich features</strong> and <strong>stability</strong> of the mkdocs-material project, while delivering <strong>new features</strong> and <strong>broad compatibility</strong>, and will adopt the following brand-new vision and positioning.
