### Differences from Material

| Aspect              |          mkdocs-material           |                       MaterialX                   |
| ------------------- |  --------------------------------  |  -----------------------------------------------  |
| **Latest Version**  |       mkdocs-material-9.7.1        | mkdocs-materialx-10.x <br />(based on mkdocs-material-9.7.1) |
| **Usage**           | Use mkdocs.yml with the theme name `material` | Use mkdocs.yml with the new theme name `materialx`, everything else is the same as when using material |
| **Current Status**  |     Nearing end-of-maintenance     |          Active maintenance and updates           |
| **Feature Updates** |      None (with legacy bugs)       | Bug fixes, new feature additions, UX improvements,<br />see [Changelog](https://github.com/jaywhj/mkdocs-materialx/releases) |

### Differences from Zensical

| Aspect         |                    Zensical                  |                        MaterialX                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Audience**   | Technical developers <br /> Technical documentation | All markdown users <br /> Markdown notes & documents |
| **Language**   |                      Rust                   |                  Python               |
| **Stage**      | Launched a few months ago, in early stages, basic functionality incomplete | Launched for over a decade, mature and stable |
| **Usage**      | Adopt the new TOML configuration format, all configurations in the original mkdocs.yml need to be reconfigured from scratch | Continue to use mkdocs.yml with zero migration cost |
| **Ecosystem**  | Built entirely from scratch, incompatible with all original MkDocs components, future development uncertain | Based on MkDocs & mkdocs-material-9.7.1, fully compatible with MkDocs' rich long-built ecosystem, open and vibrant |
| **Core Focus** | Prioritizes technical customization, with increasingly cumbersome feature configurations and ever-growing complexity in usage | Focuses on universal functions & visual presentation, extreme ease of use as primary principle, evolving to be more lightweight |
